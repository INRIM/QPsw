# scripts
- simplify CCC - either do not use or speed up processing
- interpolate calibrated errors
- fit into QWTB
- think out all corrections: are impedance corrections needed when PJVS calibration is used?
- fit into TWM

# libraries
- fix issues in infostrings
- fix issues in qwbt (mostly details)
- convert all TWM depending libraries from compiled to source distribution:
        - golpi
        - infostrings
        - vilib

# drivers
- PJVS drivers abstraction layer
- add multiplexer to TWM

# gui
